## ❓ FAQ

**Where is my data stored?**  
All data is stored in your browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). Nothing is ever sent to a server.

**Is my data encrypted?**  
No, it's stored as plain text in your browser. Do not use sensitive passwords or store confidential data.

**Can I use this on my phone?**  
Yes! The app is responsive and works in mobile browsers.

**Can I recover my data if I clear localStorage or switch devices?**  
No. Data is only on the device/browser where you use TaskMate. If you clear browser storage, your data will be lost.
